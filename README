  NAME
    YAML::Tiny::Stream - Document psuedo-streaming for YAML::Tiny

  SYNOPSIS
      my $parser = YAML::Tiny::Stream->new('lots-of-documents.yml');
      
  while ( my $yaml = $parser->fetch ) {
          # Handle the document
      }

  DESCRIPTION
    To keep the design small and contained, YAML::Tiny intentionally
    discards support for streamed parsing of YAML documents.

    In situations where a file contains a very large number of very small
    YAML documents, YAML::Tiny::Stream provides a limited implementation of
    streaming that scans for YAML's --- document separators and parses them
    one entire document at a time.

    Please note this approach does come with caveats, as any situation in
    which a triple dash occurs legitimately at the beginning of a line (such
    as in a quote) may be accidently detected as a new document by mistake.

    If you really do need a "proper" streaming parser, then you should see
    YAML or one of the other full blown YAML implementations.

METHODS
  new
      my $stream = YAML::Tiny::Stream->new($file);

    The "new" constructor creates a new stream handle.

    It takes a single parameter of a file name, which it will open via
    IO::File.

    In this quick initial implementation, the file handle will remain open
    until the stream object is destroyed.

  file
    The "file" accessor returns the original file passed to the constructor.

  handle
    The "handle" accessor returns the IO handle being used to read in the
    YAML stream.

  fetch
      my $yaml_tiny = $stream->fetch;

    The "fetch" method reads from the file until it hits the end of the next
    document. This document is then passed to YAML::Tiny to be parsed.

    Returns a YAML::Tiny object containing a single document, or "undef" if
    there are no more documents in the stream. Throws an exception if there
    is an IO or parsing error.
